# QualifyingGapAnalysis
This script performs a multi-year qualifying analysis for two Formula 1 drivers at a chosen circuit. It uses FastF1 to load qualifying data, identify teammates, and compare fastest laps. The results are displayed in a clean, styled matplotlib table for easy interpretation.

Features:
- Loads qualifying sessions for a range of years at a specified track
- Automatically identifies each driver’s teammate for every year
- Extracts fastest lap times and calculates the gap to the teammate
- Retrieves each driver’s qualifying position and formats it with ordinals
- Displays results in a color-coded table highlighting drivers and lap-time gaps
- Customizable driver colors, year range, chart size, and track
